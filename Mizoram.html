<section> <font color=orange> <h1> Why travel to Mizoram ? </h1> </font> <br> 

<i> <b> <font color=pink> "Consisting of parallel mountain ranges rising to heights of over 9,000 feet, this, the most recent acquisition to Her Majesty's dominions, embraces every variety of physical feature and climate." writes Adam Scott Reid, a 19th century servant of the British empire." </i> </b> </font> <br> 

The state of Mizoram is popularly known as the Songbird of India and is one of the smallest states in the country. The name 'Mizoram' signifies the land of the Lushai Highlanders. It is located in the southern corner of Northeast India nestled mainly between Myanmar and Bangladesh but also shares its boundary with the neighboring states of Assam, Manipur, and Tripura. The hilly region of Mizoram was previously a part of Assam but was later made a separate state. <br> 
Shrouded with the mist that prevails over the hills, not much is known or recorded about the history of Mizoram. The oral traditions of most tribes of Mizoram believe to have originated from Khul, a mythical cave in southern China that was believed to be a hole in the earth. The tea plantations in the Cachar area of southern Assam near the foothills of Mizoram were often subjected to raids by the hill tribes. <br> 
This landlocked little state is a land of scenic beauty with a variety of landscapes from the ridges of <font color=pink> <b> Aizawl, the deep gorges of Hmuifang, the valley of Champhai to the lofty peaks of Blue Mountain National Park. The hills are also blessed with beautiful water bodies such as the Vantawng Falls, Tam Dil, and Rih Dil lakes that have attracted many visitors who seek to enjoy the scenery of the highlands. </b> </font>
